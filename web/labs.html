                <p>
                    I do not have much experience with client-side web development. I have only dabbled with "Inspect Element" here and there. I use WordPress for my personal website. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The advanced CSS techniques used in this lab include the text shadow on the title and the round box around the second header.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Changing the menu to switch between a hamburger menu and normal menu depending on the size of the screen was the most challenging. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important things that I learned in this was how to create great adaptive design for many devices.

                <p>
                    Creating characteristics of the objects and the object list itself were the easy aspects of this lab.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use the JavaScript function to sort the object list was the most challenging part of this lab.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part of this lab was reading and writing cookies to the object list, while still maintaining the ability to edit their characteristics individually from the previous lab.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important things I learned from this were handling JavaScript's syntaxes because I had two bugs being a lower case i in id and a lower case c in click, which caused the list to not function properly. 
                </p>
                <h3><a href="05_js_fw/index.html">Lab 5: JS Framework Mini Web Site</a></h3>

                <p>
                    Having worked with databases in the past, this lab was pretty easy and straight forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part of this lab were filling the databases with a variety of different customer and products.

                <p>
                    The JavaScript part of this lab was easier part in this lab after taking time to understand how the Ajax called worked. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The JQuery part of this lab was a bit more challenging in this lab due to the syntax differences compared to JavaScript.

                <p>
                    Inserting information into the database through Angular was the harder part of this lab because I kept getting weird errors where it was not inserting the JSON Data correctly.
